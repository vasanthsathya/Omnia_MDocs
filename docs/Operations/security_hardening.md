# Security Hardening[¶](#security-hardening "Permanent link")

After deploying an Omnia cluster, apply these security hardening measures to protect the environment against unauthorized access, data exposure, and configuration drift. These procedures complement the security built into Omnia's default deployment (AES-256 encrypted credentials, OpenLDAP, TLS via step-ca).

## Credential rotation[¶](#credential-rotation "Permanent link")

Omnia stores sensitive credentials (database passwords, LDAP bind passwords, iDRAC credentials) in Ansible Vault files encrypted with AES-256. Rotate these credentials periodically to limit the impact of any potential exposure.

### Rotate vault passwords[¶](#rotate-vault-passwords "Permanent link")

 1. Access the `omnia_core` container:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
ssh omnia_core
```

 1. Re-key the vault file with a new password:

```bash title="Run on: omnia_core container
cd /omnia
ansible-vault rekey input/credentials.yml
```

Enter the current vault password, then provide the new password twice.

 1. Update any scripts or CI/CD pipelines that reference the old vault password.

Warning

Store vault passwords in a secure location (hardware security module, enterprise password manager). Do not commit vault passwords to version control.

### Rotate service credentials[¶](#rotate-service-credentials "Permanent link")

To rotate individual service credentials (for example, the Slurm database password or LDAP admin password):

 1. Edit the encrypted credentials file:

```bash title="Run on: omnia_core container
ansible-vault edit input/credentials.yml
```

 1. Update the relevant password fields.

 2. Re-run the appropriate playbook to propagate the new credentials:

```bash title="Run on: omnia_core container
# For Slurm credentials
ansible-playbook playbooks/omnia.yml --tags slurm

# For LDAP credentials
ansible-playbook playbooks/auth.yml
```

## TLS certificate management[¶](#tls-certificate-management "Permanent link")

Omnia uses [step-ca](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/) as an internal certificate authority (CA) to issue TLS certificates for inter-service communication.

### Check certificate expiry[¶](#check-certificate-expiry "Permanent link")

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
# List certificates and their expiry dates
step certificate inspect /etc/step/certs/server.crt --short

# Check days until expiry
step certificate needs-renewal /etc/step/certs/server.crt
```

### Renew certificates[¶](#renew-certificates "Permanent link")

Certificates issued by step-ca are typically short-lived and auto-renewed. If automatic renewal fails:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
# Manually renew
step ca renew /etc/step/certs/server.crt /etc/step/certs/server.key

# Restart affected services to pick up the new certificate
podman restart <service_container>
```

Tip

Configure monitoring to alert when certificates are within 7 days of expiry. The `step certificate needs-renewal` command exits with code 0 when renewal is needed, making it easy to integrate into a cron job or monitoring script.

## Firewall rules[¶](#firewall-rules "Permanent link")

The OIM and cluster nodes should restrict network access to only the ports required by Omnia services.

### OIM firewall configuration[¶](#oim-firewall-configuration "Permanent link")

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
# Allow SSH (management)
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh

# Allow DHCP (provisioning)
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=dhcp

# Allow TFTP (PXE boot)
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=tftp

# Allow HTTP/HTTPS (Pulp repositories, AWX)
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https

# Reload to apply
firewall-cmd --reload

# Verify active rules
firewall-cmd --list-all
```

### Compute node firewall configuration[¶](#compute-node-firewall-configuration "Permanent link")

```bash title="Run on: compute node
# Allow Slurm communication
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=6817-6819/tcp

# Allow SSH (inter-node communication for MPI)
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh

# Allow LDAP client connections
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=389/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=636/tcp

# Reload to apply
firewall-cmd --reload
```

Note

Omnia configures basic firewall rules during deployment. The commands above are for verification and for adding additional restrictions beyond the defaults.

## LDAP hardening[¶](#ldap-hardening "Permanent link")

If you are using OpenLDAP for centralized authentication, apply these hardening measures:

 1. **Enforce TLS for all LDAP connections:**

Ensure `ldaps://` (port 636) is used instead of unencrypted `ldap://` (port 389). Update the LDAP client configuration on all nodes:
```text title="File: /etc/openldap/ldap.conf
URI ldaps://auth-server.example.com
TLS_CACERT /etc/openldap/certs/ca.crt
TLS_REQCERT demand
```

 1. **Restrict anonymous binds:**

Configure the LDAP server to disallow anonymous access:
```bash title="Run on: LDAP server
ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// <<EOF
dn: cn=config
changetype: modify
replace: olcDisallows
olcDisallows: bind_anon
EOF
```

 1. **Set strong password policies:**

Configure password complexity, lockout, and expiry in the LDAP password policy overlay.

 1. **Limit LDAP admin access:**

Restrict the LDAP admin bind DN to connections originating from the OIM and authentication server only.

## Disable unnecessary services[¶](#disable-unnecessary-services "Permanent link")

Review running services on all nodes and disable anything not required:

```bash title="Run on: compute node
# List all enabled services
systemctl list-unit-files --state=enabled

# Disable services not needed on compute nodes
systemctl disable --now cups.service
systemctl disable --now avahi-daemon.service
systemctl disable --now bluetooth.service

# Verify
systemctl list-unit-files --state=enabled | wc -l
```

## Routine security updates[¶](#routine-security-updates "Permanent link")

Apply security patches regularly on the OIM and all cluster nodes:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
# Install only security updates (RHEL/Rocky)
yum update --security -y

# Check for available security updates without installing
yum updateinfo list security

# Schedule automatic security updates (optional)
yum install -y dnf-automatic
systemctl enable --now dnf-automatic-install.timer
```

Important

Schedule security updates during maintenance windows to avoid disrupting running jobs. Drain Slurm nodes before applying updates, and verify cluster health afterward (see [Add Remove Nodes](add_remove_nodes.md) for drain procedures).

## Additional recommendations[¶](#additional-recommendations "Permanent link")

 * **Audit logging** \-- Enable `auditd` on all nodes to track privileged operations and file access.
 * **SSH hardening** \-- Disable password-based SSH authentication and require key-based login. Limit SSH access to specific user groups.
 * **SELinux** \-- Keep SELinux in `enforcing` mode. Omnia playbooks are designed to work with SELinux enabled.
 * **iDRAC security** \-- Change default iDRAC passwords, disable unused protocols (Telnet, IPMI-over-LAN if not needed), and keep iDRAC firmware current.
