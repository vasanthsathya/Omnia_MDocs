# OIM Cleanup[¶](#oim-cleanup "Permanent link")

The `oim_cleanup.yml` playbook tears down the Omnia Infrastructure Manager (OIM) configuration, removing containers, services, and state so you can start fresh. This is a **destructive operation** \--- use it only when you need to completely reset the OIM.

## When to use OIM cleanup[¶](#when-to-use-oim-cleanup "Permanent link")

 * **Fresh start** \-- You want to redeploy Omnia from scratch after a failed or experimental deployment.
 * **Version upgrade** \-- You are upgrading to a new major version of Omnia that requires a clean OIM.
 * **Environment reset** \-- Lab or test environments where the OIM is frequently rebuilt.

Danger

`oim_cleanup.yml` removes Podman containers, configuration files, and state data from the OIM. **This operation cannot be undone.** Ensure you have backed up any critical data (mapping files, custom configurations, credentials) before proceeding.

## Prerequisites[¶](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

 * You are logged in as `root` on the OIM host (not inside the `omnia_core` container).
 * All cluster workloads have been drained or stopped.
 * Critical data has been backed up:

 * `/omnia/input/` (mapping files, configuration files)

 * Custom Ansible inventories
 * Any modified playbook files
 * AES-256 encrypted credential vaults

## Procedure[¶](#procedure "Permanent link")

 1. **Log in to the OIM as root:**

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
    ssh root@<oim_ip>
    ```

    !!! note
        Do **not** run this playbook from inside the `omnia_core` container.
        The cleanup process removes the container itself.

 2. **Navigate to the Omnia utils directory:**

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host
    cd /omnia/utils/
    ```

 3. **Run the cleanup playbook:**

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host
    ansible-playbook oim_cleanup.yml
    ```

The playbook performs the following actions:

 * Stops and removes all Omnia-managed Podman containers (`omnia_core`, OpenCHAMI, CoreDHCP, TFTP, Pulp, telemetry services).
 * Removes Podman pods and networks created by Omnia.
 * Deletes OIM service configuration files.
 * Cleans up SSH keys and known_hosts entries for provisioned nodes.
 * Removes cached OS images and repository data.

 * **Verify the cleanup:**

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM host
    # Confirm no Omnia containers remain
    podman ps -a | grep -i omnia

    # Confirm no Omnia pods remain
    podman pod ls
    ```

## Selective cleanup options[¶](#selective-cleanup-options "Permanent link")

If you do not need a full teardown, `oim_cleanup.yml` supports selective cleanup through extra variables:

Option | Description 
---|--- 
`cleanup_provisioning=true` | Remove only provisioning-related services (OpenCHAMI, CoreDHCP, TFTP) while keeping the `omnia_core` container and telemetry stack. 
`cleanup_telemetry=true` | Remove only telemetry services (Kafka, VictoriaMetrics, Grafana) while keeping provisioning and core services. 
`cleanup_repos=true` | Remove Pulp repository data and cached packages, freeing disk space without affecting running services. 
 
Example of selective cleanup:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
cd /omnia/utils/
ansible-playbook oim_cleanup.yml -e "cleanup_telemetry=true"
```

Tip

Selective cleanup is useful when troubleshooting a specific subsystem. For example, if telemetry is misconfigured, you can tear down only the telemetry stack and redeploy it without disturbing the rest of the OIM.

## Post-cleanup steps[¶](#post-cleanup-steps "Permanent link")

After a full cleanup, you will need to redeploy Omnia from the beginning:

 1. Re-run the OIM preparation playbook (see [Prepare Oim](../HowTo/Setup/prepare_oim.md)).
 2. Rebuild the `omnia_core` container (see [Deploy Omnia Core](../HowTo/Setup/deploy_omnia_core.md)).
 3. Reconfigure inputs and credentials (see [Configure Inputs](../HowTo/Setup/configure_inputs.md) and [Configure Credentials](../HowTo/Setup/configure_credentials.md)).
 4. Re-discover and provision nodes (see [Discover Nodes](../HowTo/Setup/discover_nodes.md)).

Info

 * [Reprovision Cluster](reprovision_cluster.md) \-- Re-image individual nodes without tearing down the entire OIM.
 * [General](../Troubleshooting/general.md) \-- Common issues that may arise after cleanup and redeployment.
