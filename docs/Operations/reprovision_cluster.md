# Re-provision Cluster Nodes[¶](#re-provision-cluster-nodes "Permanent link")

Re-provisioning replaces the operating system and software stack on existing cluster nodes. This is a full-cycle operation: nodes are re-imaged from the OIM and then reconfigured with the appropriate Omnia roles (Slurm, Kubernetes, or both).

## When to re-provision[¶](#when-to-re-provision "Permanent link")

Re-provisioning is the correct approach when:

 * **Operating system update** \-- You need to move nodes from one OS version to another (for example, RHEL 8.8 to RHEL 9.4).
 * **Configuration drift** \-- Nodes have accumulated manual changes that diverge from the desired state and a clean slate is simpler than incremental fixes.
 * **Recovery** \-- A node's OS is corrupted or a critical service has been misconfigured beyond easy repair.
 * **Role change** \-- A node is being reassigned from the Slurm cluster to the Kubernetes cluster (or vice versa).

Warning

Re-provisioning destroys all data on the target node's local disks. Ensure any important data is backed up to shared storage (NFS, PowerScale) before proceeding.

## Prerequisites[¶](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

 * The OIM is healthy and all OIM services are running (verify with [Verify Oim Services](../HowTo/Setup/verify_oim_services.md)).
 * Shared storage (NFS or PowerScale) is accessible for any data that must survive the re-provision.
 * Updated OS images have been built and are available in the Pulp repository (see [Build Cluster Images](../HowTo/Setup/build_cluster_images.md)).
 * The mapping file has been updated if node roles are changing.

## Procedure[¶](#procedure "Permanent link")

### Step 1: Drain workloads[¶](#step-1-drain-workloads "Permanent link")

Before re-provisioning, gracefully drain all workloads from the target nodes.

**For Slurm nodes:**

```bash title="Run on: Slurm control node
scontrol update NodeName=compute-03 State=DRAIN Reason="Re-provisioning"
```

Wait for running jobs to complete, or cancel them if immediate action is needed:

```bash title="Run on: Slurm control node
# Check for running jobs on the node
squeue -w compute-03

# Cancel if necessary
scancel <job_id>
```

**For Kubernetes nodes:**

```bash title="Run on: Kubernetes control plane
kubectl drain kube-worker-02 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
```

### Step 2: Update configuration[¶](#step-2-update-configuration "Permanent link")

 1. Review and update the input configuration files as needed:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
ssh omnia_core
cd /omnia/input
```

 * `mapping_file.csv` \-- Update node roles if changing.
 * `provision_config.yml` \-- Update OS image or provisioning parameters.
 * `omnia_config.yml` \-- Update cluster-level settings.

 * If building a new OS image, run the image-build process:

```bash title="Run on: omnia_core container
cd /omnia
ansible-playbook playbooks/build_cluster_images.yml
```

### Step 3: Re-image the nodes[¶](#step-3-re-image-the-nodes "Permanent link")

Run `discovery.yml` to re-discover and PXE-boot the target nodes with the updated OS image:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
cd /omnia
ansible-playbook playbooks/discovery.yml
```

The nodes will:

 1. Reboot into the PXE environment.
 2. Receive the new OS image from the OIM.
 3. Complete the cloud-init first-boot configuration.

Note

The re-imaging process typically takes 15--30 minutes per node, depending on image size and network speed.

### Step 4: Redeploy cluster software[¶](#step-4-redeploy-cluster-software "Permanent link")

After the nodes have been re-imaged and are accessible via SSH, redeploy the Omnia cluster software:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
cd /omnia
ansible-playbook playbooks/omnia.yml
```

This playbook applies the full cluster configuration, including:

 * Slurm controller and compute daemon setup
 * Kubernetes control plane and worker configuration
 * GPU drivers (CUDA / ROCm)
 * Authentication (OpenLDAP client)
 * Telemetry agents

## Verification[¶](#verification "Permanent link")

After re-provisioning is complete:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
# Verify Slurm nodes are back online
sinfo

# Verify Kubernetes nodes are Ready
kubectl get nodes

# Check for any failed Ansible tasks in the log
cat /opt/omnia/log/core/playbooks/omnia.log | grep -i "failed"

# Run a test Slurm job
srun -N 1 hostname
```
