# BuildStreaM Issues[¶](#buildstream-issues "Permanent link")

Issues related to the BuildStreaM catalog-driven CI/CD deployment workflow, including GitLab pipelines, container registry operations, catalog parsing, and OAuth credentials.

## GitLab pipeline failures[¶](#gitlab-pipeline-failures "Permanent link")

Symptom

A BuildStreaM pipeline in GitLab fails with a red status indicator. The pipeline log shows errors in one or more stages (build, deploy, test).

Cause

 * The GitLab Runner is not registered or is offline.
 * Pipeline variables (credentials, URLs) are missing or incorrect.
 * The runner does not have network access to the OIM or cluster nodes.
 * A previous pipeline left stale state that conflicts with the current run.

Resolution

 1. Check the pipeline log in GitLab:

 2. Navigate to **CI/CD > Pipelines** in the BuildStreaM project.

 3. Click the failed pipeline, then click the failed job to see its log.

 4. Verify the GitLab Runner is registered and online:

 
 
 gitlab-runner list
 gitlab-runner verify
 

 1. Check pipeline variables:

 2. Navigate to **Settings > CI/CD > Variables** in the GitLab project.

 3. Verify all required variables are set (OIM IP, credentials, registry URL).

 4. Test network connectivity from the runner to the OIM:

 
 
 # From the GitLab Runner host
 ping <oim_ip>
 ssh root@<oim_ip> hostname
 

 1. If stale state is the issue, clean up and retry:

 
 
 # Clear the runner's build cache
 gitlab-runner clear-cache
 
 # Retry the pipeline from GitLab UI
 

## Registry push failures[¶](#registry-push-failures "Permanent link")

Symptom

The BuildStreaM pipeline fails during the image push stage with errors such as:
 
 
 Error: failed to push image: authentication required
 Error: failed to push image: denied: requested access to the resource is denied
 

Cause

 * Container registry credentials are incorrect or expired.
 * The registry URL in the pipeline configuration is wrong.
 * The registry's TLS certificate is not trusted by the runner.
 * The registry storage is full.

Resolution

 1. Verify registry credentials:

 
 
 podman login <registry_url>
 

 1. Check that the registry URL matches the pipeline configuration:

 
 
 grep -i registry .gitlab-ci.yml
 

 1. If TLS is the issue, add the registry's CA certificate:

 
 
 cp <registry_ca.crt> /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
 update-ca-trust
 

Or configure Podman to trust the registry:
 
 
 # /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/buildstream.conf
 [[registry]]
 location = "<registry_url>"
 insecure = true # Not recommended for production
 

 1. Check registry storage:

 
 
 df -h <registry_data_dir>
 

## Catalog parse errors[¶](#catalog-parse-errors "Permanent link")

Symptom

The BuildStreaM pipeline fails during the catalog parsing stage with errors such as:
 
 
 Error: Failed to parse catalog: invalid YAML syntax at line 42
 Error: Unknown component type 'slurm_cluser' in catalog entry
 

Cause

 * The catalog YAML file has syntax errors (indentation, missing colons, invalid characters).
 * A catalog entry references a component type that does not exist (typo).
 * Required fields are missing from a catalog entry.

Resolution

 1. Validate the catalog file syntax:

 
 
 python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('catalog.yml'))"
 

 1. Use a YAML linter for more detailed error reporting:

 
 
 pip install yamllint
 yamllint catalog.yml
 

 1. Check for typos in component types. Valid types include:

 2. `slurm_cluster`

 3. `kubernetes_cluster`
 4. `telemetry`
 5. `authentication`
 6. `storage`

 7. Verify all required fields are present in each catalog entry. Refer to the [Update Catalog Pipeline](../HowTo/BuildStreaM/update_catalog_pipeline.md) guide for the catalog schema.

 8. After fixing errors, commit and push to trigger a new pipeline:

 
 
 git add catalog.yml
 git commit -m "Fix catalog syntax errors"
 git push
 

## OAuth credential issues[¶](#oauth-credential-issues "Permanent link")

Symptom

BuildStreaM operations fail with OAuth authentication errors when communicating with GitLab or external services:
 
 
 Error: OAuth token expired or revoked
 Error: 401 Unauthorized: invalid_token
 

Cause

 * The OAuth token has expired.
 * The OAuth application was deleted or its secret was rotated in GitLab.
 * The token scope does not include the required permissions (`api`, `read_registry`, `write_registry`).

Resolution

 1. Check the current token status:

 
 
 curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
 https://<gitlab_url>/api/v4/user
 

A `401` response confirms the token is invalid.

 1. Generate a new personal access token in GitLab:

 2. Navigate to **User Settings > Access Tokens**.

 3. Create a new token with scopes: `api`, `read_registry`, `write_registry`.

 4. Update the token in pipeline variables:

 5. Navigate to **Settings > CI/CD > Variables**.

 6. Update the `GITLAB_TOKEN` (or equivalent) variable with the new token.

 7. If using an OAuth application (rather than personal token):

 8. Navigate to **Admin Area > Applications** (or **User Settings > Applications**).

 9. Verify the application exists and note the Application ID and Secret.
 10. Update the pipeline variables with the new credentials.

 11. Re-run the failed pipeline from the GitLab UI.
