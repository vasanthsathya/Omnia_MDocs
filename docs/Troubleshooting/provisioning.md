# Provisioning Issues[¶](#provisioning-issues "Permanent link")

Issues related to PXE booting, node discovery, cloud-init configuration, and the `discovery.yml` playbook.

## PXE boot failures[¶](#pxe-boot-failures "Permanent link")

### NIC not set to PXE boot[¶](#nic-not-set-to-pxe-boot "Permanent link")

Symptom

The target node does not attempt a network boot. It boots directly to the local disk or enters the BIOS setup instead of requesting a PXE image from the OIM.

Cause

The node's BIOS/UEFI boot order does not include PXE/network boot, or PXE is disabled on the NIC connected to the admin network.

Resolution

 1. Enter the node's BIOS/UEFI setup (press F2 during POST on Dell PowerEdge servers).
 2. Navigate to **System BIOS > Network Settings**.
 3. Enable **PXE Boot** on the NIC connected to the admin network.
 4. Navigate to **Boot Settings > BIOS Boot Settings** (or **UEFI Boot Settings**).
 5. Set **Network Boot** (PXE) as the first boot option.
 6. Save and exit BIOS. The node should now attempt PXE boot on the next restart.

Alternatively, use `racadm` to configure remotely:
```bash title="Run on: BMC via racadm
racadm set NIC.NICConfig.1.LegacyBootProto PXE
racadm set BIOS.BiosBootSettings.BootSeq NIC.Slot.1-1
```

### Wrong MAC address in mapping file[¶](#wrong-mac-address-in-mapping-file "Permanent link")

Symptom

The node PXE boots but does not receive an IP address, or it receives an IP but is not recognized by OpenCHAMI.

Cause

The MAC address in `/omnia/input/mapping_file.csv` does not match the actual MAC address of the NIC being used for PXE boot.

Resolution

 1. Verify the correct MAC address from iDRAC or the node's BIOS:

```bash title="Run on: BMC via racadm
# From iDRAC (using racadm)
racadm getsysinfo | grep "MAC Address"
```

 1. Update the mapping file with the correct MAC:

```bash title="File: /omnia/input/mapping_file.csv
# /omnia/input/mapping_file.csv
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF,compute-01,10.5.0.101
```

 1. Re-run the discovery playbook:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
ssh omnia_core
cd /omnia
ansible-playbook playbooks/discovery.yml
```

### DHCP not serving IP addresses[¶](#dhcp-not-serving-ip-addresses "Permanent link")

Symptom

Nodes attempt PXE boot but fail with a DHCP timeout error:
```text title="PXE DHCP error
PXE-E51: No DHCP or proxyDHCP offers were received
```

Cause

 * The CoreDHCP container on the OIM is not running.
 * The DHCP range is exhausted.
 * A network misconfiguration prevents DHCP broadcasts from reaching the OIM.
 * Another DHCP server on the same network is interfering.

Resolution

 1. Verify the CoreDHCP container is running:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
podman ps | grep coredhcp
```

If it is not running, start it:
```bash title="Run on: OIM host
podman start coredhcp
```

 1. Check CoreDHCP logs for errors:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
podman logs coredhcp
```

 1. Verify no rogue DHCP server exists on the admin network:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
nmap --script broadcast-dhcp-discover -e <admin_nic>
```

 1. Ensure the OIM's admin NIC is on the correct VLAN and subnet.

### TFTP timeout during PXE boot[¶](#tftp-timeout-during-pxe-boot "Permanent link")

Symptom

The node receives a DHCP lease but fails to download the boot image:
```text title="PXE TFTP error
PXE-E32: TFTP open timeout
PXE-T02: TFTP packet timeout
```

Cause

 * The TFTP service on the OIM is not running.
 * Firewall rules on the OIM are blocking TFTP traffic (UDP port 69).
 * The TFTP root directory does not contain the expected boot files.

Resolution

 1. Verify the TFTP container is running:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
podman ps | grep tftp
```

 1. Check firewall rules:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
firewall-cmd --list-all | grep tftp
```

If TFTP is not allowed:
```bash title="Run on: OIM host
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=tftp
firewall-cmd --reload
```

 1. Verify boot files exist in the TFTP root:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
ls /var/lib/tftpboot/
```

## cloud-init issues[¶](#cloud-init-issues "Permanent link")

Symptom

Nodes boot the OS successfully but post-boot configuration fails. The node is accessible via console but network settings, hostname, or SSH keys are not configured correctly.

Cause

 * The cloud-init data source is not configured.
 * The cloud-init configuration file has syntax errors.
 * The cloud-init service was disabled or removed from the OS image.

Resolution

 1. Check cloud-init status on the affected node:

```bash title="Run on: target node
cloud-init status --long
```

 1. Review cloud-init logs:

```bash title="Run on: target node
cat /var/log/cloud-init.log
cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
```

 1. Verify the data source configuration:

```bash title="Run on: target node
cat /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/
```

 1. If cloud-init was disabled, re-enable it:

```bash title="Run on: target node
systemctl enable cloud-init
cloud-init clean
reboot
```

## `discovery.yml` failures[¶](#discoveryyml-failures "Permanent link")

Symptom

The `discovery.yml` playbook fails with errors related to OpenCHAMI, BMC connectivity, or inventory population.

Cause

 * OpenCHAMI services (SMD, BSS) are not running on the OIM.
 * BMC/iDRAC credentials are incorrect.
 * The BMC network is unreachable from the OIM.

Resolution

 1. Verify OpenCHAMI services are running:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
podman ps | grep ochami
```

 1. Test BMC connectivity:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
# Ping the BMC IP
ping <bmc_ip>

# Test Redfish API access
curl -k -u <user>:<pass> https://<bmc_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems
```

 1. Verify BMC credentials in the configuration:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
ssh omnia_core
ansible-vault view /omnia/input/credentials.yml
```

 1. Check discovery logs for detailed errors:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
cat /opt/omnia/log/core/playbooks/discovery.log
```

## Nodes not appearing after discovery[¶](#nodes-not-appearing-after-discovery "Permanent link")

Symptom

After running `discovery.yml` successfully, the expected nodes do not appear in `ochami-cli smd components list` or `sinfo`.

Cause

 * The node's BMC did not respond during the discovery window.
 * The node's MAC address does not match any entry in the mapping file.
 * The node booted but failed cloud-init, so it did not register with the OIM.

Resolution

 1. Check the OpenCHAMI inventory:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
ssh omnia_core
ochami-cli smd components list
```

 1. Verify the node's BMC is responsive:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
ping <bmc_ip>
curl -k -u <user>:<pass> https://<bmc_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems
```

 1. Re-run discovery for the specific node by power-cycling it via iDRAC:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
racadm -r <bmc_ip> -u <user> -p <pass> serveraction powercycle
```

 1. Monitor the discovery log in real time:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host
tail -f /opt/omnia/log/core/playbooks/discovery.log
```
