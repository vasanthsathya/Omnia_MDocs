# Update Catalog & Pipelines[¶](#update-catalog-pipelines "Permanent link")

Update the BuildStreaM catalog file to modify your cluster configuration and trigger CI/CD pipeline runs to apply changes.

## Overview[¶](#overview "Permanent link")

The BuildStreaM catalog is a declarative YAML file that defines your entire cluster configuration:

 * Node assignments and roles.
 * Software stacks and versions.
 * Network configuration.
 * Storage and authentication settings.

When you update the catalog and push changes to GitLab, a CI/CD pipeline automatically validates the changes and (optionally) applies them to the cluster.

## Prerequisites[¶](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

 * GitLab is deployed and configured (see [Deploy Gitlab](deploy_gitlab.md)).
 * The BuildStreaM catalog repository is initialized.
 * A GitLab Runner is registered and active.
 * You have Git access to the catalog repository.

## Procedure[¶](#procedure "Permanent link")

 1. **Clone the catalog repository** (if not already cloned):

Run on: omnia_core container
 
 
 cd /opt/omnia
 git clone http://<oim-ip>:8082/root/buildstream-catalog.git
 cd buildstream-catalog
 

 1. **Edit the catalog file** :

Run on: omnia_core container
 
 
 vi catalog.yml
 

Example catalog structure:

File: /opt/omnia/buildstream-catalog/catalog.yml
 
 
 ---
 catalog_version: "2.1.0"
 cluster_name: "omnia-prod"
 
 # Operating system
 os:
 type: "rhel"
 version: "8.8"
 iso_path: "/opt/omnia/iso/RHEL-8.8-x86_64-dvd.iso"
 
 # Networks
 networks:
 admin:
 nic: "eno1"
 subnet: "10.5.0.0/24"
 gateway: "10.5.0.1"
 range: "10.5.0.100-10.5.0.200"
 bmc:
 nic: "eno2"
 subnet: "10.3.0.0/24"
 range: "10.3.0.100-10.3.0.200"
 
 # Node groups
 node_groups:
 slurm_control:

 nodes:
 - service_tag: "ABCDEF1"

 bmc_ip: "10.3.0.101"

 # Software stacks
 software:
 - slurm
 - cuda
 - apptainer
 - openldap
 
 # Telemetry
 telemetry:
 enabled: true
 idrac: true
 ldms: true
 

 1. **Make your changes**. Common modifications include:

 2. Adding new nodes to a `node_groups` section.

 3. Changing the software stack.
 4. Updating network ranges.
 5. Enabling/disabling telemetry.

 6. **Commit and push the changes** :

Run on: omnia_core container
 
 
 cd /opt/omnia/buildstream-catalog
 git add catalog.yml
 git commit -m "Add 2 new compute nodes to slurm cluster"
 git push origin main
 

 1. **Monitor the pipeline** in GitLab:

Open the GitLab web UI and navigate to: **CI/CD** > **Pipelines**

The pipeline runs through the following stages:

 * **validate** \-- Checks catalog syntax and validates input files.
 * **provision** \-- Discovers and provisions new/changed nodes (manual trigger).
 * **configure** \-- Applies Slurm/K8s/telemetry configuration (manual trigger).
 * **verify** \-- Runs health checks on the updated cluster.

 * **Manually trigger deployment stages** :

In the GitLab pipeline view, click the **Play** button next to the `provision` and `configure` stages to execute them.

 1. **Review pipeline artifacts and logs** :

Click on a completed job to view its logs. Download artifacts from the **Artifacts** section if available.

## Verification[¶](#verification "Permanent link")

 1. **Verify the pipeline completed successfully** :

In GitLab, navigate to **CI/CD** > **Pipelines**. The latest pipeline should show all stages with green checkmarks.

 1. **Verify catalog changes were applied** :

Run on: omnia_core container
 
 
 # Check if new nodes were provisioned
 ochami node list
 
 # Check Slurm configuration
 ssh <slurm-control-ip> sinfo
 

 1. **Run the verification stage** to confirm cluster health:

Run on: omnia_core container
 
 
 ansible all -m ping
 

## Next Steps[¶](#next-steps "Permanent link")

 * [Buildstream Troubleshooting](buildstream_troubleshooting.md) \-- Debug pipeline failures.
 * [Deploy Gitlab](deploy_gitlab.md) \-- Update GitLab or runner configuration.

## Troubleshooting[¶](#troubleshooting "Permanent link")

**Pipeline fails at "validate" stage** Check the job logs for validation errors. Common issues:

 * YAML syntax errors in `catalog.yml`
 * Missing required fields
 * IP address conflicts

Fix the catalog and push a new commit.

**Pipeline fails at "provision" stage** \- Check that BMC IPs are reachable for new nodes. \- Verify credentials are configured. \- Review the Ansible playbook output in the job logs.

**Pipeline fails at "configure" stage** \- Check that provisioned nodes are reachable. \- Verify the Vault password is available to the runner. \- Review Ansible output for specific task failures.

**Git push is rejected** Check GitLab authentication:

Run on: omnia_core container
 
 
 git remote -v
 # Ensure URL is correct and credentials are configured
 

**Pipeline not triggered on push** Verify `.gitlab-ci.yml` exists in the repository root and the runner is active:

Run on: OIM host
 
 
 podman exec gitlab-runner gitlab-runner list
