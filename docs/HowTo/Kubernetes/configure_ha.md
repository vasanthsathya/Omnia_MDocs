# Configure Kubernetes HA[¶](#configure-kubernetes-ha "Permanent link")

Enable high availability (HA) for the Kubernetes control plane using a virtual IP (VIP) that floats between control-plane nodes for API server redundancy.

## Overview[¶](#overview "Permanent link")

By default, the Kubernetes API server is accessible on each control-plane node's individual IP address. For production deployments, a virtual IP (VIP) provides a single, stable endpoint for the API server. If the active control-plane node fails, the VIP automatically migrates to a healthy node.

Omnia uses **kube-vip** or **keepalived** to manage the virtual IP, depending on your configuration.

## Prerequisites[¶](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

 * A Kubernetes cluster deployed with 3 control-plane nodes (see [Setup Service K8S](setup_service_k8s.md)).
 * A free IP address on the admin network subnet for the VIP.
 * The VIP address must not be in the MetalLB address range or assigned to any other device.

## Procedure[¶](#procedure "Permanent link")

 1. **Enter the omnia_core container** :

```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
ssh omnia_core
```
 

 2. **Configure the virtual IP** in `omnia_config.yml`:

```bash title="Run on: omnia_core container"
vi /opt/omnia/input/project_default/omnia_config.yml
```
 

Add or update the HA parameters:

```yaml title="File: /opt/omnia/input/project_default/omnia_config.yml
---
# Kubernetes HA configuration
k8s_ha_enabled: true
k8s_vip: "10.5.0.200"
k8s_vip_interface: "eno1"
```
 

!!! warning
    The `k8s_vip` must be a free IP address on the same subnet as the
    control-plane nodes. Do **not** use an IP from the MetalLB range.

 3. **Run the omnia.yml playbook** (or re-run to apply HA changes):

```bash title="Run on: omnia_core container"
cd /omnia
ansible-playbook omnia.yml --ask-vault-pass
```
 

If the cluster is already deployed, the playbook will:

 * Deploy kube-vip or keepalived on control-plane nodes.
 * Configure the VIP as the API server endpoint.
 * Update kubeconfig on all nodes to use the VIP.
 * Reconfigure the kube-apiserver with the new advertised address.

 * **Alternatively, configure HA manually** on an existing cluster:

a. **Install keepalived** on all control-plane nodes:
 
 
 ```bash title="Run on: each K8s control plane node"
 dnf install -y keepalived
 ```
 

b. **Configure keepalived** on the primary control-plane node:
 
 
 ```bash title="Run on: K8s control plane node 1 (MASTER)"
 cat <<'EOF' > /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
 vrrp_instance K8S_VIP {
 state MASTER
 interface eno1
 virtual_router_id 51
 priority 100
 advert_int 1
 authentication {
 auth_type PASS
 auth_pass k8s_vip_secret
 }
 virtual_ipaddress {
 10.5.0.200/24
 }
 }
 EOF
 
 systemctl enable --now keepalived
 ```
 

c. **Configure keepalived** on backup control-plane nodes:
 
 
 ```bash title="Run on: K8s control plane nodes 2 and 3 (BACKUP)"
 cat <<'EOF' > /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
 vrrp_instance K8S_VIP {
 state BACKUP
 interface eno1
 virtual_router_id 51
 priority 90
 advert_int 1
 authentication {
 auth_type PASS
 auth_pass k8s_vip_secret
 }
 virtual_ipaddress {
 10.5.0.200/24
 }
 }
 EOF
 
 systemctl enable --now keepalived
 ```
 
 
 !!! note
    Set `priority 80` on the third control-plane node.

## Verification[¶](#verification "Permanent link")

 1. **Verify the VIP is active** :

```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
ping -c 3 10.5.0.200
```


 1. **Check which node currently holds the VIP** :

```bash title="Run on: each K8s control plane node"
ip addr show eno1 | grep "10.5.0.200"
```
 

Only one node should show the VIP.

 1. **Access the Kubernetes API via the VIP** :

```bash title="Run on: K8s control plane node"
kubectl --server=https://10.5.0.200:6443 get nodes
```
 

 1. **Test failover** by stopping keepalived on the active node:

```bash title="Run on: active K8s control plane node"
systemctl stop keepalived
```
 

Then verify the VIP migrated:

```bash title="Run on: OIM host"
ping -c 3 10.5.0.200
# Should still respond -- VIP migrated to a backup node
```
 

Re-enable keepalived:

```bash title="Run on: previously active node"
systemctl start keepalived
```
 

 1. **Update kubeconfig** to use the VIP:

```bash title="Run on: K8s control plane node"
kubectl config set-cluster kubernetes --server=https://10.5.0.200:6443
```
 

## Next Steps[¶](#next-steps "Permanent link")

 * [Deploy Powerscale Csi](deploy_powerscale_csi.md) \-- Deploy enterprise storage integration.
 * [Setup Telemetry](../Telemetry/setup_telemetry.md) \-- Deploy telemetry on the HA cluster.

## Troubleshooting[¶](#troubleshooting "Permanent link")

**VIP is not reachable** Check keepalived status on all control-plane nodes:

```bash title="Run on: each K8s control plane node"
systemctl status keepalived
journalctl -u keepalived --no-pager -n 20
```
 

**VIP does not failover** Verify VRRP traffic is allowed on the network. Check for firewall rules blocking multicast:

```bash title="Run on: K8s control plane node"
firewall-cmd --add-protocol=vrrp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```
 

**Both nodes claim the VIP (split-brain)** Ensure all control-plane nodes have the same `virtual_router_id` and `auth_pass` in keepalived.conf. Check network connectivity between control-plane nodes.

**kubectl fails with "connection refused" on VIP** Verify the API server is listening on the VIP address:

```bash title="Run on: K8s control plane node"
ss -tlnp | grep 6443
```
