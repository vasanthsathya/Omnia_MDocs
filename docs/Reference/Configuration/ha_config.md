# high_availability_config.yml Reference[¶](#high_availability_configyml-reference "Permanent link")

File path: `/opt/omnia/input/project_default/high_availability_config.yml` (also referred to as `ha_config.yml`)

This file configures Kubernetes control plane high availability (HA) using a virtual IP address and load-balanced API servers.

## Parameter reference[¶](#parameter-reference "Permanent link")

Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description 
---|---|---|---|--- 
`ha_enabled` | Boolean | No | `false` | Enable Kubernetes control plane high availability. When `true`, multiple `kube_control_plane` nodes share a virtual IP. 
`ha_virtual_ip` | String (IP) | Conditional | (none) | Virtual IP address for the Kubernetes API server. Clients and worker nodes connect to this IP instead of a single control plane node. Required when `ha_enabled` is `true`. Must be on the same subnet as the control plane nodes' admin network. 
`ha_load_balancer` | String | No | `kube-vip` | Load balancer technology for the control plane virtual IP. Accepted values: `kube-vip`. Additional options may be supported in future releases. 
`ha_control_plane_port` | Integer | No | `6443` | Port on which the Kubernetes API server listens. The virtual IP forwards traffic to this port on all control plane nodes. 
`ha_etcd_external` | Boolean | No | `false` | Use an external etcd cluster instead of the embedded etcd that runs on each control plane node. When `true`, provide etcd endpoints via `ha_etcd_endpoints`. 
`ha_etcd_endpoints` | List | Conditional | `[]` | List of external etcd endpoints (e.g., `["https://10.5.0.10:2379", "https://10.5.0.11:2379"]`). Required when `ha_etcd_external` is `true`. 
 
## HA architecture overview[¶](#ha-architecture-overview "Permanent link")

Component | Description 
---|--- 
**kube-vip** | Runs as a static pod on each control plane node. One node is elected leader and holds the virtual IP. If the leader fails, another control plane node takes over within seconds. 
**Virtual IP** | A floating IP that is always routable to the current leader. All `kubelet` and `kubectl` connections target this IP. 
**etcd** | By default, each control plane node runs its own etcd instance (stacked topology). Alternatively, an external etcd cluster can be specified. 
 
## Prerequisites[¶](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

 * Minimum **3 control plane nodes** for a quorum-based HA deployment.
 * The `ha_virtual_ip` must be a free IP on the admin network subnet -- it must not be assigned to any physical server or DHCP range.
 * All control plane nodes must have L2 connectivity on the admin network for ARP-based virtual IP failover.

## Usage example[¶](#usage-example "Permanent link")

```yaml title="File: /opt/omnia/input/project_default/high_availability_config.yml
ha_enabled: true
ha_virtual_ip: "10.5.0.250"
ha_load_balancer: "kube-vip"
ha_control_plane_port: 6443
ha_etcd_external: false
```
