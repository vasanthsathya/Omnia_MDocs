# Network Topologies[¶](#network-topologies "Permanent link")

Omnia v2.1 supports three network topology models. The choice of topology determines how the OIM, cluster nodes, and switches are physically and logically connected.

## Topology comparison[¶](#topology-comparison "Permanent link")

Topology | OIM NIC Layout | Node NIC Layout | Best For 
---|---|---|--- 
**Dedicated** | Separate NICs for admin and BMC networks (minimum 2 NICs, optionally 3+ for compute/public). | Separate NICs for admin and BMC; additional NICs for compute and public. | Production environments requiring full network isolation between management and data traffic. 
**LOM** | LAN-on-Motherboard (LOM) ports carry both admin and BMC traffic on a single physical NIC using VLAN tagging. | LOM ports with VLAN-tagged admin and BMC traffic. | Environments with limited NIC availability; shares onboard ports for multiple functions. 
**Hybrid** | LOM ports for admin/BMC (shared, VLAN-tagged) plus dedicated add-in NICs for compute and public networks. | LOM ports for admin/BMC; add-in NICs for compute/public. | Balanced approach: saves NIC slots for high-speed data while using onboard ports for management.

### Dedicated topology[¶](#dedicated-topology "Permanent link")

Network | OIM Interface | Node Interface | Description 
---|---|---|--- 
Admin | Dedicated NIC (e.g., `eno1`) | Dedicated NIC (e.g., `eno1`) | Provisioning, Ansible, and SSH management traffic. Untagged. 
BMC | Dedicated NIC (e.g., `eno2`) | iDRAC dedicated port | Out-of-band management (iDRAC). Separate physical network. 
Compute | Optional add-in NIC | Add-in NIC (e.g., ConnectX-6) | High-speed data plane for MPI, NCCL, and storage I/O. 
Public | Optional add-in NIC | Optional add-in NIC | Internet-facing or campus network. Not required for all deployments. 
 
### LOM topology[¶](#lom-topology "Permanent link")

Network | OIM Interface | Node Interface | Description 
---|---|---|--- 
Admin | LOM port (e.g., `eno1`, VLAN tagged) | LOM port (VLAN tagged) | Shares the physical port with BMC using 802.1Q VLAN tagging. 
BMC | LOM port (e.g., `eno1`, VLAN tagged) | iDRAC shared LOM | iDRAC configured in shared LOM mode; tagged on a separate VLAN. 
Compute | Not applicable | Add-in NIC (if available) | Optional. If present, used for high-speed traffic. 
Public | Optional | Optional | Uplink to external network if needed. 
 
Note

In LOM topology, the switch ports must be configured as VLAN trunk ports carrying both admin and BMC VLANs. Configure the iDRAC to use **Shared LOM** mode in the BIOS/iDRAC settings.

### Hybrid topology[¶](#hybrid-topology "Permanent link")

Network | OIM Interface | Node Interface | Description 
---|---|---|--- 
Admin | LOM port (VLAN tagged) | LOM port (VLAN tagged) | Shares LOM with BMC, as in the LOM topology. 
BMC | LOM port (VLAN tagged) | iDRAC shared LOM | Same as LOM topology. 
Compute | Dedicated add-in NIC | Dedicated add-in NIC (e.g., ConnectX-6) | High-speed dedicated fabric. Physically separate from management. 
Public | Dedicated add-in NIC | Optional add-in NIC | Dedicated port for external connectivity. 
 
## Topology and `network_spec.yml` mapping[¶](#topology-and-network_specyml-mapping "Permanent link")

`network_spec.yml` Field | Dedicated Topology Value | LOM / Hybrid Topology Value 
---|---|--- 
`admin_network.oim_nic_name` | Physical NIC name (e.g., `eno1`) | VLAN sub-interface or LOM port (e.g., `eno1`) 
`admin_network.netmask_bits` | Subnet mask for admin VLAN (e.g., `20`) | Subnet mask for admin VLAN (e.g., `20`) 
`bmc_network` | Separate physical subnet | VLAN-tagged subnet on the same LOM 
`compute_network` | Dedicated add-in NIC | Dedicated add-in NIC (Hybrid) or absent (LOM)
