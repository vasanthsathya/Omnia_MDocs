# Supported Servers[¶](#supported-servers "Permanent link")

Omnia v2.1 supports the following Dell PowerEdge server models as cluster nodes (OIM, Slurm, and Kubernetes). Servers are grouped by CPU architecture.

## Intel-based servers[¶](#intel-based-servers "Permanent link")

Model | CPU Generation | Form Factor | Notes 
---|---|---|--- 
PowerEdge R660 | Intel 4th/5th Gen Xeon Scalable | 1U rack | Dual-socket; suitable for OIM, Slurm control, or login nodes. 
PowerEdge R760 | Intel 4th/5th Gen Xeon Scalable | 2U rack | Dual-socket; general-purpose compute and storage. 
PowerEdge R760xa | Intel 4th/5th Gen Xeon Scalable | 2U rack | GPU-accelerated variant; supports up to 4 double-width GPUs. 
PowerEdge R770 | Intel 5th Gen Xeon Scalable | 2U rack | Dual-socket; next-generation general-purpose compute. 
PowerEdge C6620 | Intel 4th/5th Gen Xeon Scalable | 2U multi-node (4 sleds) | High-density; 4 independent dual-socket sleds per 2U chassis. 
PowerEdge XE9680 | Intel 4th/5th Gen Xeon Scalable | 6U rack | AI/ML optimized; supports up to 8 NVIDIA GPUs (SXM5 or PCIe). 
PowerEdge XR7620 | Intel 4th/5th Gen Xeon Scalable | 1U short-depth | Edge-optimized; ruggedized, suitable for edge HPC deployments. 
PowerEdge XR8620t | Intel 4th/5th Gen Xeon Scalable | 2U short-depth | Edge-optimized; supports GPU accelerators in edge environments. 
PowerEdge XR8000r | Intel 4th/5th Gen Xeon Scalable | Modular | Modular edge platform with configurable sled options. 
 
## AMD-based servers[¶](#amd-based-servers "Permanent link")

Model | CPU Generation | Form Factor | Notes 
---|---|---|--- 
PowerEdge R6615 | AMD EPYC 4th Gen (Genoa) | 1U rack | Single-socket; cost-effective for OIM or lightweight compute. 
PowerEdge R7615 | AMD EPYC 4th Gen (Genoa) | 2U rack | Single-socket; extended storage capacity. 
PowerEdge R6625 | AMD EPYC 4th Gen (Genoa) | 1U rack | Dual-socket; high core density for parallel workloads. 
PowerEdge R7625 | AMD EPYC 4th Gen (Genoa) | 2U rack | Dual-socket; balanced compute and storage. 
PowerEdge R7725 | AMD EPYC 4th Gen (Genoa) | 2U rack | Dual-socket; GPU-ready with PCIe Gen5 expansion. 
PowerEdge C6625 | AMD EPYC 4th Gen (Genoa) | 2U multi-node | High-density; multiple independent compute sleds per chassis. 
 
## ARM-based servers (Grace CPU)[¶](#arm-based-servers-grace-cpu "Permanent link")

Model | CPU | Form Factor | Notes 
---|---|---|--- 
PowerEdge R770-G | NVIDIA Grace CPU (ARM, AArch64) | 2U rack | ARM architecture; requires `build_image_aarch64.yml` for image creation. Uses separate OS image from x86_64 nodes. 
 
Note

ARM nodes require provisioning with the `build_image_aarch64.yml` playbook. The x86_64 image built by `build_image_x86_64.yml` is **not** compatible with ARM-based servers.
