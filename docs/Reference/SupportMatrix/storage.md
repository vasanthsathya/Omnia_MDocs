# Supported Storage[¶](#supported-storage "Permanent link")

Omnia v2.1 supports the following Dell storage platforms for shared filesystems and persistent volumes.

## Storage support matrix[¶](#storage-support-matrix "Permanent link")

Platform | Version | Protocol | Notes 
---|---|---|--- 
Dell PowerScale (Isilon) | OneFS 9.x | NFS, SMB | Scale-out NAS; ideal for shared home directories and scratch filesystems. Omnia configures NFS client mounts on cluster nodes. 
Dell PowerVault ME5 | ME5 Series | iSCSI, FC, SAS | Block storage; suitable for databases, boot volumes, and high-IOPS workloads. Omnia configures iSCSI initiators on target nodes. 
 
## PowerScale (OneFS) integration[¶](#powerscale-onefs-integration "Permanent link")

Parameter | Description 
---|--- 
OneFS version | 9.x (9.4 or later recommended) 
Access zone | Configure a dedicated access zone for HPC exports to isolate permissions and authentication. 
Protocol | NFS v3 or NFS v4.x -- configured in `storage_config.yml` (see [Storage Config](../Configuration/storage_config.md)). 
Authentication | Local, LDAP, or Active Directory. Must match the cluster authentication method configured in `security_config.yml`. 
SMB support | Supported for Windows or mixed-OS clients. Not used by default in Omnia HPC deployments. 
 
Note

Omnia mounts PowerScale NFS exports on cluster nodes using the mount parameters specified in `storage_config.yml`. The PowerScale cluster itself must be configured and operational before running `omnia.yml`.

## PowerVault ME5 integration[¶](#powervault-me5-integration "Permanent link")

Parameter | Description 
---|--- 
Series | ME5012, ME5024, ME5084 
Protocol | iSCSI (default for Omnia integration), Fibre Channel, SAS 
Volumes | Pre-create LUNs and map them to host groups before running Omnia storage playbooks. 
Multipath | DM-Multipath (`device-mapper-multipath`) is recommended for redundancy and load balancing. 
Configuration | `storage_config.yml` specifies the PowerVault management IP, volume mappings, and mount points. 
 
## BeeGFS parallel filesystem[¶](#beegfs-parallel-filesystem "Permanent link")

In addition to Dell storage appliances, Omnia supports BeeGFS as a software- defined parallel filesystem running on cluster nodes.

Component | Description 
---|--- 
BeeGFS version | Consult `local_repo_config.yml` for the configured version. 
Server roles | Management, metadata, and storage services can run on dedicated nodes or co-located with compute nodes. 
Client | Omnia installs the BeeGFS client on designated nodes and mounts the filesystem at the path specified in `storage_config.yml`.
